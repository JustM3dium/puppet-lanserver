    <h3>Downloading Games</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To download games, you need a BitTorrent Client. You can find it for x86 <a href=tools/transmission-2.94-x86.msi>here</a> or for x64 <a href=tools/transmission-2.94-x64.msi>here</a>.</li>
        <li>The client mentioned above must be installed. Click through the installation dialogs and configure your installation path if you want.</li>
        <li>Now click this <a href=/games.html>URL</a> and search for the correct game.</li>
        <li>Download the <b>*.torrent</b> file of the game and add it to your BitTorrent client.</li>
        <li>The download should start after a few seconds. You can find the Download in your BitTorrent download directory you configured.</li>
        <li>You should keep the client active in the background all the time, so other peers can download the file from your client too. This improves the the speed when someone else download files.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>An overview of all supported games (including installation instruction) is <a href=games.html>here</a></p>
    <p>Files uploaded by users are <a href=/upload>here</a></p>

    <h3>Downloading games</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To upload games you need a FTP client. For example Filezilla. You can find a download link for x86 <a href=tools/FileZilla_3.33.0_win32-setup_bundled.exe>here</a> and for x64 <a href=tools/FileZilla_3.33.0_win64-setup_bundled.exe>here</a>).</li>
        <li>Install it and click through the installation dialogs.</li>
        <li>Start Filezilla and connect to the following address: <b>"server.lan"</b>. The port number is <i>22</i> but it's optional</li>
        <li>Now you upload <i>*.zip</i>, <i>*.rar</i> or <i>*.7z</i> archives into the <i>upload</i> directory of FTP server.</li>
        <li>When the upload is completed, there will be a <i>*.torrent</i> file in the <a href=/upload><i>upload</i></a> directory of this website. Other people can download the <i>*.torrent</i> file and share them in the network.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Unfortunately uploading directory isn't supported. Just upload archives of a directory. If you need a program to archive a directory, you can use 7-Zip. You can download it for x86 <a href=tools/7z1805.exe>here</a> or for x64 <a href=tools/7z1805-x64.exe>here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Chat</h3>
    <p>If you want to chat with other people, you can join the local IRC server. You can find a Web Client <a href="http://server.lan:8080/">here</a>. Insert a nickname and then chat happily with all other participants. There is also a desktop client for IRC called HexChat. You can download it from the <a href="tools/">/tools</a> section and  install it.</p>
